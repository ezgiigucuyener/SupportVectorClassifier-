# SupportVectorClassifier-

In this particular example, linearly unseperable, random data is created and plotted. Then it's fitted with support vector classifier using kernel trick. The accuracy is calculated as %100. Then different kernels such as linear, rbf, poly and sigmoid are used to train the data and calculate the accuracy in order to visualize the different mathematical approaches they hold. Lastly grid search is applied to the data and the score is calculated as &100 since our data is not very complex.
